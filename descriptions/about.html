Hello! I'm Ananmay, a Computer Engineering Major at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My professional interests lie in Autonomous Systems and their Applications. Other than that, I like music, movies, and running.

Cool Facts:-

1) I'm the Software Lead for Illinois AUV, where we build an autonomous submarine every year to compete at Robosub, San Diego. For code, check my github linked below.
2) I love creating/recreating fingerstyle interpretations of popular music with my Guitar. Youtube channel linked below.
3) I love Football, the real one.
